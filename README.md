# Statistical Models Project

This repository contains a project by Marco Gaudio analyzing a healthcare dataset from Kaggle to investigate variables related to stroke diagnosis. The project utilizes various statistical models and is implemented in R using R Markdown.

## Summary

The project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset to identify factors associated with stroke. The dataset includes 12 variables such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle factors. Key steps in the analysis include:

- **Data Import and Preprocessing:** Loading and cleaning the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Summarizing and visualizing the data to understand variable distributions and relationships.
- **Modeling:** Applying statistical models including logistic regression and classification trees to predict stroke occurrences.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing model performances using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and ROC curves.

The analysis aims to provide insights into significant predictors of stroke and evaluate the effectiveness of different modeling techniques.
